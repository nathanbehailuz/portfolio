# Hello World!

I'm Nathan, a rising senior at New York University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics. I currently work in the MOMA Lab, where I explore the intersection of Federated Learning, Machine Unlearning, and Responsible AI.

Previously, I served as a Machine Learning Research Assistant at the Center for Responsible AI under Professor Julia Stoyanovich, where I worked on multi-group intersectional fairness in classification tasks. My contributions included implementing and evaluating fairness-aware algorithms, designing experiments, refining predictive models, and analyzing fairness thresholds and regions.

I also worked as a Big Data Research Assistant with Professor Gabriel-Kohler Derrick at NYU and Professor Jeremy Bowles at University College London. This project involved extracting structured data from over 40,000 pages of historical records on precolonial Ireland using OCR, followed by extensive post-processing and socio-economic analysis.
